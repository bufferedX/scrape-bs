# Football Stats Visualization Project

Welcome to the Football Stats Visualization project! 🚀 This project combines web scraping, real-time data visualization, and Python magic to bring you dynamic insights into football statistics.

## Overview

In this project, we leverage Python and various libraries to scrape real-time data from [fbref.com](insert_fbref_link_here) and create engaging visualizations. The main components include:

- **Season-wise Stats:** Explore live standout performances, goals, assists, and more for each team in the chosen season.

- **Team-wise Stats for Each Season:** Dive into detailed stats for a specific team across multiple seasons, crafted with Python finesse for real-time insights.

- **Python Magic - Behind the Scenes:** The project uses the following Python packages:
  - Streamlit: For creating interactive web apps effortlessly.
  - Pandas: Powering data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib: Crafting stunning visualizations for data storytelling.
  - Numpy: Handling numerical operations with efficiency.
  - Beautiful Soup: Transforming messy HTML into structured data for web scraping.
  - Plottable: Creating elegant and interactive visualizations with ease.
